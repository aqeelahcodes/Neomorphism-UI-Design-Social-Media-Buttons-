## Why the project is useful
Neumorphism or Soft UI is a combination of flat design and skeuomorphism. By adding intense drop/box shadows to elements, it creates an effect that the element is able to be pushed or interacted with.

## Steps:
- Step 1: Ran IDE Visual Studio Code with its built-in command line to create 1 folder containing 2 files index.html and style.css 
- Step 2: In HTML created a container element that holds social media icons from https://fontawesome.com/
- Step 3: In CSS removed default styles and created custom styles for the html elements and also imported fonts form Google
- Step 4: Deployed the app using GitHub Pages
